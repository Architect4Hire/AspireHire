* Caching with **Azure Cache for Redis** for hot data (profiles, job listings).
* Asynchronous background jobs (e.g., notifications, emails) to prevent blocking.

### Security

* Secrets managed in **Azure Key Vault** with managed identities.
* Defense-in-depth against SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.

### Reliability & Availability

* Zone-redundant AKS deployment with multi-region failover.

* Database HA via **Azure SQL Database** and **Cosmos DB** replication.

### Maintainability

* **Microservice decomposition**: Auth, Profile, Job, Proposal, Payment, Messaging, Notification.

* CI/CD pipelines via **Azure DevOps** or **GitHub Actions**.
* Automated unit/integration tests included in pipelines.

### Compliance

* **PCI-DSS** compliance through third-party payment provider.
* **GDPR**: user data export and deletion capabilities.
* Inheritance of Azure compliance certifications.

### Observability
